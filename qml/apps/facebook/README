*   QMLFB version 0.1b by Jesse Ikonen
*  =======================================*
*
*	Simple QML Component that authenticates your users using Facebook Graph.
*
*
*/

Usage:


* Use like any file component. Facebook application id property is required:

    Facebook {
        id: facebook
        property string facebook_display_style: "touch" // or "wap"
        property string facebook_application_id: "<YOUR FB APP ID HERE>"

        function whenUserIsAuthenticated(userid, usertoken){
            // access graph to get my name
            my_graph(function(){main.name = this["name"]});
        }
    }


* Some properties you can hook into:

    facebook.user_is_authenticated	=> returns if user is authenticated or not (bool)
    facebook.user_facebook_id		=> returns user fb id
    facebook.user_facebook_token	=> returns user fb token
    facebook.my_pic_url 		=> returns your picture url (string)
    facebook.me		=> returns your fb graph data (variant) so you can do things like, text: facebook.me.name

* Access functions to graph are not done yet, but you can use getJSON helper from helpers.js if you really need something else.


Thank you.
